#### Executive Summary
Graduation Project 20.1: Initial Report and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Reasons
Why should people care about this question?
The project aims to understand the relationship between different health factors such as diabetes and stroke based on the analysis of health data. This understanding can help improve disease diagnosis and provide more accurate and effective treatments, which contributes to improving the overall health of individuals.

#### Research Question
What question are you trying to answer?
I am trying to answer how different health factors affect the likelihood of diabetes and stroke using graphical analysis and data modeling techniques.

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer your question?
I used a health dataset that includes information on diabetes, stroke, blood pressure, age, and body mass index, which was obtained from the Kaggle data source.

#### Methodology
What methods do you use to answer the question?
I used Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends in the data. I create predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and SVC, and improve the performance of the models using optimization techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search.

#### Results
What did you find from your research?
The research results found that the Random Forest model performs well compared to other models. For diabetes, we got an accuracy of 74.49%, while the results for stroke were unsatisfactory with an accuracy of 93.85% but with low F1 Score and Recall. Improving models using Random Search and Grid Search showed that some algorithms can improve performance, but the results vary depending on the model.

#### Next Steps
What are the suggestions for next steps?
The focus should be on improving the performance of stroke models that had unsatisfactory results. The influencing factors can also be studied more deeply and additional machine learning algorithms or new data processing techniques can be tested to obtain more accurate results.
